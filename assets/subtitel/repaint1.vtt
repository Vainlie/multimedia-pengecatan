00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.080
hey everyone in some of our past videos

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.040
we've shown you how to paint a car

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.719
starting from bare metal today we want

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.679
to show you something different how to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.520
repaint your car this is going to be a

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.160
different more budget friendly approach

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.119
with minimal component removal that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.960
might be applicable to your daily driver

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.640
a car you want to clean up a bit to sell

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.880
or if you're not doing a full frame off

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.920
restoration our candidate is this fox

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.480
body Mustang we're using it because the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.160
hood and passenger door door are in

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
pretty rough shape but the fenders

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
driver door and quarters are fairly

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.640
straight also we're going to paint it

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.710
with the same color which eliminates

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.829
needing to do jams with that let's get

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.829
[Music]

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.480
started all right so the first step is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
to take a good hard look at the car and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.559
come up with a plan for repair the hood

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.000
has clear coat peeling some surface rust

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.960
popping through the paint but look

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.359
straight otherwise we're going to strip

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.440
it to bare metal and take it through the

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.879
full process

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.960
ACC the passenger door has a dent and a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.680
rusty spot underneath the mirror we'll

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.720
need to do some body work address the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.200
rust and then Prime the repair before

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.840
moving on the passenger fender and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.360
driver door have a couple scratches IND

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.880
dents that will need a skim coat of body

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.119
filler and then primed as well finally

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.079
the bumper quarter and Driver Fender are

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.320
straight so they only need to get sanded

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.920
with 600 grip before moving on our

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040
general approach to this is similar to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240
how a production shop might handle it

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.240
this isn't the car to do a full

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.439
restoration to we just want to clean it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.079
up make it a bit more presentable and a

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.040
cool thing to cruise around it so now

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.280
that we have a plan we can move into the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.280
actual work and start our

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.280
[Music]

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.280
repairs so first thing we're going to do

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.000
is address this problem area we're going

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.159
to start by taking some of this molding

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.119
off this mirror to do that we're going

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.880
to have to pop inside the car take off

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.840
the interior door panel then we can

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.840
start getting to work

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.399
with the mirror out of the way the next

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.159
step is to grind off the old rust so we

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.720
can do some metal work on the panel

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.239
immediately we realize that someone has

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.840
been here before as I grind into

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.120
previous body work not a huge problem

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.879
but never great to find we just have to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.760
grind all that form of filler out before

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.879
moving on knowing we also need to strip

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.120
the hood which will then require primer

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.680
we can start that repair as well it's a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.319
good practice to try and bring all your

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.640
repairs up through the stages at the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.680
same time that way as you move through

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.879
the process on various panels you'll be

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.879
using similar tools at the same time you

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.120
could move panel by panel but it's less

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:43.000
efficient we use thect and a red 80 grit

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.640
drum to get the hood back to Bare Metal

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.440
you can also see we taped up the edges

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.080
of the adjacent panels so we don't

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.480
accidentally damage

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.480
them just like the door we find some old

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.640
filler hiding on the hood it actually

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.440
was in decent shape but the best move is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.959
to strip it too so we know it's been

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.519
applied correctly we bump up to the 120

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.959
grit drum on the

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.959
and finish stripping and conditioning

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.319
the hood

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.239
metal with our two main areas of damage

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.599
strip to Bare Metal we can jump back on

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.440
the door and continue the repair okay so

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.360
we sanded down the door we got rid of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.239
some of the old bad body work we know

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.239
that we have a low spot here it's high

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.159
all around this area so what we're going

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.760
to do is we're going to take the Mig 90

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.680
weld a small coupon right here and then

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.840
take our locking plier Slide Hammer pull

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.560
on this low spot while tapping down our

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.879
highs so now I can go ahead and apply

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.959
outward pressure which is going to help

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.239
bring out the low while hitting our high

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.560
spots right around here and drive the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.560
metal towards the low

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.840
spot for any metal work the closer you

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.680
can get the damaged area back to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.040
straight in metal the better that way

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.760
you can limit the thickness of body

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.040
filler that will need to be applied

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.799
which makes for a longer lasting repair

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.799
with a couple passes we get this

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.519
straight with the metal work completed

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.680
we feather out the damaged area on the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.519
door with 80 grit on the dsb then wipe

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.239
down with pre painting prep and start

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.239
applying body

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.200
filler while the door filler is

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.280
hardening up we can move some of our

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.680
other panels towards the filler stage

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.120
with the hood now stripped we need to

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.280
address the rust that has been popping

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.320
through the old paint all right so we

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.440
got the Mustang Hood all stripped it's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.400
looking solid it's pretty straight one

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.639
area that's going to need to be

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.120
addressed no problem something we did

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.240
run into however is a little bit of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.199
surface rust and pitting all across the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.000
hood now the abrasive tools won't get to

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.840
that right so da dsb SCT nothing is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.120
going to get down into those little pits

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
so what we're going to do to address

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.840
that is we're going to use our fast Edge

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.479
and what that's going to do is it's

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.440
going to treat all those areas so that

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.600
we can go ahead move on with the process

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.199
put epoxy primer over top and then get

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.479
this thing into paint now the steps are

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.360
very simple first we're going to wipe

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.680
this whole thing down with pre wipe it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.800
off make sure it's completely dry then

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.800
we're going to take our fast etch spray

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.280
it liberally over the whole Hood make

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.919
sure it stays wet for about a half an

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.600
hour then we'll go ahead wipe it off

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.039
with some more pre we can move on to

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.039
epoxy

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:17.199
primer now we can go ahead and spray

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.720
[Music]

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.160
it this will convert the rust to iron

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.759
phosphate and allow us to epoxy over top

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.600
with the hood now in a stable State we

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.639
can continue to do the repair on it and

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.160
a few other spots around the car using

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.880
the same techniques as the door grind if

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.360
needed feather with the dsb coat with

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.160
body filler as we work through the body

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.440
filler we do several passes of blocking

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.520
with 80 grit on the dsv and checking

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.840
with guide

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.080
coat guide coat is great because it will

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.479
identify your low spots so you know to

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.199
either continue blocking or apply more

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.919
filler we work from 80 grit up through

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.319
320 grit making sure to remove scratches

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.680
from the previous grit as we move

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.479
forward once we get everything straight

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.479
we can move to the next step

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.560
primer so as you all know there are lots

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.919
of options when moving from body work to

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.039
primer epoxy urethane polyester and so

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.840
on for this since we have the hood

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.479
completely in bare metal we're going to

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.960
apply our optiflow roll-on epoxy primer

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.680
since it has great adhesion to both

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.800
metal and body filler this kit is also

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.680
great because you can do it in your

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.160
driveway or garage without the need for

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.520
a compressor booth and spray gun the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.400
hood is pretty straightforward as the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.280
whole panel needs to be coated when you

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.880
have to Prime mid panel it's a slightly

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.479
different approach when taping you can

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.319
use the edges to give you a nice hard

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.720
line to work up to if one's close if

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.680
it's right in the middle like our door

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.680
repair or Fender don't create an

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.160
arbitrary tape Edge and then Prime right

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.319
up to it you want to feather The Edge as

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.680
much as possible whether using a gun or

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.560
in our case a roller that way you can

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.120
sand the primer back and have a seamless

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.039
transition that you won't see later with

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.879
that in mind we put all our panels into

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.080
aox

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.199
primer once again we can coat them and

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.960
guide coat before we start sanding so we

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.720
can make sure everything is staying nice

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.800
and even we let everything sit for a day

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.879
or two so we can move on to blocking

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.280
with the dsb starting with 180 220 and

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:19.800
then 320

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.759
git for all areas the block doesn't

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.199
quite fit such as these indents on the

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.160
hood we use a red scuff pad to get these

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.319
areas ready for

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.000
[Music]

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.560
urethane

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.879
all right so we got the Mustang through

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.560
the epoxy stage everything sanded up to

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:38.160
320 grit and looking pretty good couple

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.199
breakthroughs but that's okay cuz we're

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.039
going to move on to urethane so our

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.520
urethane is going to be our last coat of

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:45.400
primer and it's going to fill in any

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.599
remaining sanding scratches and give us

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.440
one more chance to catch any wavy lines

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.360
we're going to continue with the

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.759
optiflow system and what's awesome about

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.639
it is that you can do this right in your

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:55.879
driveway and the only spraying will be

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.360
from an aerosol can all right so we

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:59.879
wiped down the car with pre painting

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.280
prep and now we can go ahead mix this up

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.759
4 to one start rolling it on the car now

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.680
some of you might be asking is it

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:08.599
necessary to use all these priming steps

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.960
and the answer is really a case-by casee

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:13.000
basis production shops will typically

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.360
just fix the repair like our door and

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.840
coat with urethane only but our Hood was

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.840
bare metal and it's definitely ideal to

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.680
coat it with epoxy first then urethane

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.400
ultimately it's up to you but our

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.960
results turned out great and this is the

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.240
workflow we used just like the epoxy it

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.240
rolls on nice and

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.240
easy

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:34.800
while the primer gets hard over the next

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.599
day or so we're going to address some of

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.599
the other items on the car we'll need to

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:40.240
remove these taped on moldings and some

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:42.240
faulty Hardware that didn't come apart

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.320
during

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.279
disassembly to get these moldings off

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.360
you have a couple options you could just

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:50.080
try forcibly ripping them off but that

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.160
takes a lot of force and can end up

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.240
adding waves to the panel underneath

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.200
another option is a spreader which works

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.320
great on small stuff like our LX badge

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.000
and Ford logo but is tough on these long

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.399
moldings the best option would be to use

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.839
fishing line but ours keeps breaking so

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:07.279
we're going to use welding wire this

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:09.240
works for us because we're planning on

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:10.959
painting the car but if you just want to

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.240
remove them stick with the fishing line

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:14.240
so you don't damage the paint

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:19.480
underneath you can see I had to create

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:22.440
handles with some vice grips because

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.800
these things were really stuck on here

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.399
with the moldings off we have to deal

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.040
with sticky residue Left Behind the SAT

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.959
has an eraser wheel attachment that's

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.399
perfect for this

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:33.600
put the tool on the lowest setting and

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:35.360
work down the panel avoid sitting on one

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.839
spot as it can add some heat and burn

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.320
the paint after the first pass we go

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:42.160
back with some pre painting prep thect

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.160
and a gray scuff pad to get any

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.480
remaining

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.880
glue switching back over to primer

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.590
everything is coated in a last layer of

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.200
guide coat and block the 320 on the

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:55.560
[Music]

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.720
DSP now we can finally move on to our

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.880
next step prepping the car for paint in

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.720
keeping the car moving through the

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.480
stages together now we can sand the

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.040
whole car up to 600 we start by

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.959
aggressively sanding the peeling clear

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.720
coat from a previous paint job with 400

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:12.720
grit on a DA then we switch over to 600

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.230
on an interface pad and sand the whole

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.519
car including our blocked

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.680
[Music]

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:20.720
primer the goal here is to provide our

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.440
next step with some tooth to adhere to

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.200
and to remove any previous sanding grit

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.959
scratches so we don't see them in our

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.440
final result during this you might find

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:30.440
some small imperfections you hadn't

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.640
noticed in the previous steps such as

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.640
cracked paint something peeling or a

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.399
rock chip for those smaller affected

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.839
areas we address them by using the same

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:41.360
steps as before sanding out the damage

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:43.560
getting the affected area to 320 priming

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.880
them and then sanding with 600 along

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.880
with the rest of the panel all right so

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.639
we're wrapping up Wy work on the Mustang

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.320
before we get it into final paint I want

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:53.880
to give it one last check to make sure

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.040
everything's super straight to do that I

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.839
grab perfect panel check fluid spray it

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.120
on the door and I can look down the

00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:03.040
panel check out the flection which would

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.279
indicate highs lows bad body

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:09.839
work this stuff's awesome because unlike

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:12.320
water or something similar it'll stay on

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:14.120
here for about an hour and we can see

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.160
that the light is going nice and

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.200
straight which tells us our body work is

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.560
super flat and we can move

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.399
on our last step before moving into

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.040
paint is to run over the entire car with

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:26.800
a gray scuff pad and make sure there's

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.120
nothing left shiny on the

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.440
body once again this will ensure that we

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.440
get good mechanical adhesion for our top

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:39.079
coats and with our car straight sanded

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.079
and smooth we can move into

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.399
[Music]

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.440
paint with everything ready to go we can

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:50.720
start taping the car up to get into the

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.279
booth now this is a bit different from

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.040
things we've shown you in the past as we

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:56.920
still have headlights a couple pieces of

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.519
trim and glass still on the car as

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.000
mentioned earlier we're not doing a full

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:03.040
Resto on this mustang so the tip here is

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.279
disassemble as much as you can to get

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.440
the desired result your classic 68

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:09.160
Camaro calls for more than the beater 98

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.399
Civic you daily

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.519
drive with that said we can make sure to

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:15.880
hide any tape lines beneath the trim

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:17.839
back tape to provide soft edges and use

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.560
foam tape in our jams to seamlessly go

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:21.920
from our fresh new paint job to our

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.920
Factory

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.920
one once the car's in the booth taped up

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.920
wipe down the entire car with pre

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.399
painting prep or wax and grease remover

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.279
to make sure everything's perfectly

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:37.519
clean and then follow up with a tack rag

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:40.199
this will make sure no dust dirt or lint

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:42.000
is on the body of the car for this job

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:44.000
we wanted to show you how it pro paints

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.399
so we invited our friend and prob body

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.160
guy/ painter ready to spray the Mustang

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:55.360
so we got some Eastwood epoxy here that

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.760
if we over Reduce by 20% we can make

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.760
into

00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:02.920
sealer so what sealer will do is just

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.839
give us a nice wet bed over any

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.199
imperfection just to really lock

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:07.720
everything down make sure we don't have

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:10.079
anything that's going to cause an issue

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:14.680
when we go to clear our gun settings are

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:16.399
1.7 needle 25 psi 50% overlap and we

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.079
start with a dry tack coat and then a

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:19.079
heavier wet

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.710
[Music]

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:30.040
coat now at this point in the day we

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:32.519
simply ran out of time to continue

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.320
painting which really isn't ideal our

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:36.360
plan was to lay down sealer and then top

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.600
coat immediately but we ended up laying

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.519
down the sealer scuffing with 600 and

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.360
then moving to Ray shop to finish up the

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:44.560
following

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.160
weekend back to the car in the booth

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.800
ready for base coat we mix the OEM base

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.759
coat up and fill our spray gun raised

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:58.199
gun settings are 1.3 needle 15 to 20 psi

00:13:53.759 --> 00:14:00.040
10-in fan 50% overlap medium wet we

00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:03.120
start spraying and get three solid coats

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:10.920
on the car with 15-minute flash times in

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:13.120
[Music]

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.000
between all right well we grabbed our

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.560
sun gun now we're going to turn the

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.920
lights off turn the fan off so you can

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.240
hear me a little bit we're going to go

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.680
see how our coverage is looking so we're

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:29.440
just looking to see if anything is see

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.440
through we see any blotches spots or

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.040
anything crazy poking

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.440
through so it's a little modly on the

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.759
hood so we're going to turn the fans on

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.920
and I'm going to do a little bit of a

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:44.560
drop coat I'm going to use the same

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.240
trigger same needle same pressure I'm

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.560
just going to pull the gun up a little

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.639
bit to let the metallics really cover up

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.639
anything and dry

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.680
[Music]

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.680
uniformly

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:10.199
[Music]

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:13.120
this is my first time using Eastwood

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:15.920
anything kind of paint and uh coverage

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.560
was pretty good laid out pretty good

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.959
given it's a small car it's a fox body

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.639
and a convertible so we don't have to

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:24.800
worry about the roof I'd say we have a

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:26.800
quarter of a gallon left so put that on

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.959
the Shelf in the corner for the next

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.920
time a grocery car gets it or something

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:36.360
all right ready for clear we're using

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:39.279
the uh Eastwood 4:1 premium show clear

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.199
so that's four parts clear one part

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:46.880
hardener that's it we're going to spray

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:49.279
it with a 13 tip probably like 29 PSI if

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.920
I had to guess but car's looking good in

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:53.560
base we're ready to go we're not going

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.360
to tack it off it's a pretty heavily

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.759
metallic color so I'm worried if I tack

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.839
it you'll get some white marks in it it

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:03.079
and everything so we're just going to

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:05.880
let it all seal up with some clear and

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:05.880
we'll be good to

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:17.169
[Music]

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.529
[Music]

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.519
roll all right all done clearing the

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.240
Mustang I'm happy with how it went

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:32.839
bumpers even look good for being on the

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.399
car that's not my favorite way to do it

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:37.480
really had to push the show car clear we

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:39.800
used a medium hardener and uh I was

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.120
calling for mid 70s today it's 82 in the

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.680
booth you want to be on the back side of

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.079
that you kind of want to give yourself a

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.279
little time for in between coats so you

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:51.480
can go mix some more and uh it came out

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.680
flat came out nice and shiny which is

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.600
what we're looking for today we let the

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.000
car sit in the booth for about an hour

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.480
untape and then bring it back to

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.480
Eastwood for some final assembly

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.400
and wao this thing looks better than

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:09.760
ever all of our heavily damaged areas

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:13.240
delaminated clear and Rusty spots are

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.439
now in the distant past the best part is

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.880
we had our Pro step in and painted in a

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:20.079
downdraft Booth which let us reassemble

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.559
and we haven't even had to do any paint

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:24.360
correction the OEM paint is a great

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:27.400
match and let us move forward without

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.870
having to cut in or blow the car apart

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.240
anymore

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:33.200
[Music]

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.559
now could this job have been even better

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.520
yes we could have done some more

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:38.280
disassembly and spent another month on

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.039
the Bodywork but it's not what the job

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.320
called for and we already have a video

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:44.039
showing you all that we wanted to

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.039
illustrate how you might do a simplified

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:47.480
version of our full paint process on

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:48.840
something like your daily driver or

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.320
budget

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.000
build and to get great results like this

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.550
and paint your car any of our thousands

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:06.539
of options head over to eastwood.com
