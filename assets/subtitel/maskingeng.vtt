professional level and i do have a lot

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
to learn from you guys as well so today

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
we're going to be learning how to mask a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
car now what we have over here are two

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
doors that we're going to be masking and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
i'm going to show you some quick

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.550
techniques on how to do this exactly now

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.410
let me tell you masking a car sometimes

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.530
can be overwhelming where do you put

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.420
tape where don't you put tape it's kind

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.649
of an art so today what we're going to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.649
be doing is we're gonna be going over

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.840
the tape thing new technology and paint

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.460
it's gonna be showing us how to tape

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.930
things gonna help us out do we need the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.659
tape thing to paint a car or to tape a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.210
car absolutely not but will it help you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.220
out I really do think so so we have

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.369
different types of tape here which we're

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.400
going to go over right now so your first

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.369
budget tape that you have here is your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.350
smart brand tape and the cheaper the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.850
tape the less it's going to stick it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.070
might come off a little bit here and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.150
there so this is a smart brand tape

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.270
those two still do the job it's kind of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.790
like that 3m painters tape but I find it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.939
has just a little less sticky to it the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.680
next tape what we have is three ends

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.780
budget tape which is their yellow which

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.250
still works pretty good you'll find that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.740
it's a little bit more rigid

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.420
it doesn't really been as easy but it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.750
will get the job done and it's still a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.909
very good option 3m has a lot of budget

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.430
options for those that don't want to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.530
spend as much money but still want good

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.280
quality results the last tape that we

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.799
have here is my personal favorite it is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.929
three M's hyland and what I like about

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.300
3m Thailand is it works great in high

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.360
humidity it's got a little a lot of bend

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.520
to it and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.040
it's not going to release easily it's

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.820
one of my favorite tapes and then over

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.670
here what we have is three M's new flex

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.750
tape and it's got actual ridges in it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.400
that this is for fine line like when

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.710
you're contouring around a bumper or

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.180
something like that when you really want

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.550
to get a nice clean edge

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.530
it actually contours pretty pretty well

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.230
and in coming videos I'll show you how

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.900
to do this on a bumper so what is the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.910
tape thing exactly well the tape thing

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.410
is right here tape caddy and you can

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.030
find this on collegiate collision

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.030
edge.com

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.290
okay that's collision edge comm and this

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.780
is just going to make your life ten

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.709
times easier now you put it right here

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.390
if you have a belt it goes right over

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.270
your belt me it's going over my pants

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.450
fits in real easy so it comes with many

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.130
adapters and the adapters the tape

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.050
actually has to fit within so they'll

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.520
tell you right here you know if it's an

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.050
inch and a half 1/2 inch three quarters

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.440
whatever it is so it supposed to spin

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.260
freely okay so like I said we have all

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.350
these different tapes they spend freely

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.300
super easy so it's easy as this all

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.420
you're gonna do is take your tape you

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.930
come right here BAM you are good to go

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.090
so here I can take my tape if I want to

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.530
turn it around the other way that's not

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.910
a problem you're left-handed

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.920
right-handed if you have you're on your

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.160
left or your right and then I say I want

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.840
to switch it out just come right here

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.760
pop it right there I'm good to go

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.280
so we're gonna be utilizing the tape

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.340
thing tape caddy excuse me to help us

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.110
out with this actual taping of this

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.820
vehicle so the most important thing that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.290
you need to do before you tape is you

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.100
need to use your wax and grease remover

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.560
and a clean pad and you need to clean

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.600
where the tape is gonna be back mass so

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.730
so for instance on this particular door

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.070
we're gonna be putting tape along the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.620
back edge so that overspray doesn't get

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.459
through we'll be putting foam tape in

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.260
this area right here and then over on

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.859
the back door we're gonna be putting

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.900
tape on the backside back masking all

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.820
throughout the leading edge of the back

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.530
door so he's gonna back mask that what

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.810
that means is he's putting the reverse

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.460
putting it just reverse and he's using

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.960
two-inch you could use an inch and a

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.090
quarter whatever works for you

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.000
it doesn't matter and he's just gonna go

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.880
along the whole bottom excuse me the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.650
whole back of this storage and then he's

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.860
gonna carry it all the way through here

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.860
[Music]

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.590
quick tip you always want to mask from

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.140
the back to the front so you always

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
start with your back door you open that

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.210
up

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.250
do all your masking and then you close

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.770
your front door and then you're good to

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.240
go so that might help you out and then

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520
when you go to unmask you start with the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.650
front door and then do the reverse but

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.470
he's gonna do here is on the bottom he's

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.050
going to use the same method and we're

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.930
gonna attach our plastic to that so the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.300
whole door is back masked and it's ready

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.560
pretty much for paper so what we're

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.030
gonna do real quick is gonna have you

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.910
put the little caddy on and see if you

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:27.670
like it use this take this it shouldn't

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.110
you know you're skinnier than me fit

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.620
right in there alright so then that goes

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.950
and you can reverse the tape if you want

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.020
that's good okay okay so what he's gonna

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.660
do now is he's got the tape caddy going

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.360
and he's gonna pull it just a little bit

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.460
pull it towards the back and that's

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.290
gonna help keep that bridge away from

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.680
there so when the clear coat goes it

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.030
doesn't stick to both take it and pull

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.410
it nice so it's nice and tight and now

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.780
what he's gonna do is he's gonna tape

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.190
the top and he's in a back mass this

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.190
area the same way

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.250
perfect and then he can fill in the gaps

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.380
it's a little tight here because the

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.450
mullah the way the door it is but you

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.450
could still stick a little bit now we do

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.810
like the Highland because it works great

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:32.380
for the humidity it sticks well it's

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.260
thin it's easy to conform and then right

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.390
in here you can just tape it he doesn't

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.360
actually need to actually do back mask

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.860
here and then what he'll do is they'll

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.140
put like a little piece of tape here and

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.540
there so in the plastic comes over it

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.790
doesn't actually stick to it and pull it

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.460
down just to keep it against the window

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.990
kind of helps out so now we're what

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.090
we're gonna do with this door edge is

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.940
we're gonna be putting foam we like to

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.130
use foam because it it fits in there

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.620
well and does exactly what we need to do

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.870
and that foam is just really simple you

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.270
don't stretch it because if you stretch

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.470
it it's gonna come loose so all you do

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.760
is just fit it right into that groove

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.010
they make different millimeters

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.790
different sizes and that's totally that

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.770
leave a nice soft edge along that that

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.950
inside of that door so that when they go

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.510
to pull it off you can give a little

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.729
buff but actually there's a rubber that

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.860
sits there anyways so now on the inside

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:29.260
this door he's gonna use you can switch

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.419
it out you can use I guess take this the

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.020
Lord what I have it over here take this

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:39.580
see if it works good pop that there and

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.770
then you're gonna tape the inside

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.610
because we don't want we want a nice gap

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.900
a nice nice seal between the two and

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.810
he's just gonna run this right at the

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:54.340
edge of it right at the very very edge

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:56.580
all the way down you're better than I

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.580
thought

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:04.720
isn't it kind of therapeutic therapeutic

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.820
I used to say do I love hate basking

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.850
more do I hate buffing and I think I

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.300
hate buffing yeah masking is not that

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.220
bad

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.560
good I mean you could really if you want

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.700
we can run one more yeah you can run a

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.310
thicker one you don't need to use that

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.540
and that's just gonna help make sure

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:23.680
there's no overspray that seeps through

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:25.780
the gap here all right so he's running

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.240
that tape on the on the bottom side as

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.060
well and we come over on this side

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.400
that's what it looks like so this will

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.370
all come together once we put the

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.530
plastic on it'll all make sense so same

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.300
thing here is gonna run it all across he

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:43.180
can get a big long piece if you want and

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:46.360
then we'll show you we'll get into how

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.370
to mask these off and little random

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.770
holes here and there this is very basic

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:54.760
and future videos will do we wheel well

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:56.680
masking will do inside of the hood we

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.660
usually take everything off so we're not

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.890
going to show you masking off bumpers

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.230
and stuff like that because you just

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:06.520
don't do that so right here all he's

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:08.140
gonna do is you can use inch and a

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.210
quarter or the half inch edges and go

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.240
straight down it's gonna tuck it in just

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:15.100
a little bit if there was any moldings

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.200
in there we would remove them I could

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.850
get overspray on this car there there

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.040
already been removed so we're good to go

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.570
so he'll just take tuck it in you can

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.400
even use like a little bit of a Phillips

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:29.550
head pocket screwdriver or your

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.550
fingernail to make sure it's good to go

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.040
and for here what he's gonna do it just

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.390
put a piece of tape inside nothing

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.150
special here just covering off from

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.190
overspray going inside the door and get

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.250
him inside the car now while he's doing

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:48.280
that we're gonna talk about right in

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.500
here now we're gonna put a little tape

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.410
over these black moldings and the screws

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.970
so it doesn't get any sort of overspray

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.060
on it but right in here we're going to

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:00.280
use foam tape and this is just another

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.100
good way to utilize it and I'm gonna

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.120
show you the right way to fold it

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.280
opposed to the way that I wouldn't

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.950
suggest okay so there's two ways that I

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:12.400
would do this you could fold it you're

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.630
gonna fold it like this okay that's how

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.210
you fold it but when you're going to put

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.940
it in you don't put it in like this

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:21.010
because that's just more areas for dirt

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.700
to hang out and come out just put it in

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:26.500
like this okay now that's a little bit

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.290
not big enough so we'll just crunch this

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.780
in here and we have thicker tape that

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.010
will it cut hold the whole cover the

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.120
whole little bit better so this one's

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.390
too thin so we actually get a thicker

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.930
one we'll use this for the front so same

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:47.620
thing

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:47.620
[Music]

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.080
I like the blue foam a little bit more

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:59.870
for here yeah it's a little bit cheaper

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.870
and then over here same thing

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.690
so we have all of our area the whole two

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.030
doors the whole perimeter of the two

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.380
doors is completely good to go

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.930
this is probably going to be one of your

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.740
easier things to mass off and so what

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.170
we're gonna is gonna pull over to

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.900
plastic and then we'll give some tips on

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.730
how to cover the car with the plastic so

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:36.300
we're gonna go ahead we'll pull this

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:38.600
over the car it's not supposed to happen

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.600
like that

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.000
[Music]

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.310
this is a smart brand it's not 3m

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.740
all right so when your bring it over

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.260
just gently you want to create too much

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.910
static I don't go flapping it because

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.100
that just puts a whole bunch of static

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:16.140
on the actual vehicle and then you'll

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:17.310
really get stung shocked so the first

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.230
thing you want to do is just bring it

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.680
all on the side that you're painting

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:26.060
[Music]

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.060
bring it all the way down to the bottom

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.589
nice and neat

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:45.230
okay so once you have it down then what

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.120
you're going to do on this side is

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:52.700
you're going to start sticking it to all

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:55.400
of that back master area like this so

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.670
I'm just going to come here and stick it

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:02.060
to all your areas just by pushing it now

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:05.000
remember our areas over here our back

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:07.839
mass so we'll pull it here and just give

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.290
it I want to come from this angle over

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:18.020
okay and then over here come down I just

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:20.120
hit that tape on the bottom alright so

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.460
now we have a nice tight area you see

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.860
Diaz over here pulling it tight and I

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:33.200
give it like a little bit of a knot

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:36.140
alright so what we'll do here is we're

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.520
gonna start cutting it out and as we cut

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.250
it out we always want to use like a

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.860
fresh razor because you're just gonna

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:45.800
tear it up and he's just gonna cut along

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.770
the dotted line pretty much and as he

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:54.170
cuts along that line we're just gonna

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:57.220
tape so we're just gonna pull it off

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.220
where he taped

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:13.410
and we're going back to 3m uh classic

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:17.070
let's see this like saran wrap just come

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:22.949
across the whole entire area it's better

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:25.139
to have long consistent tape selections

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:27.690
if you want to call it now no tears no

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:32.480
brakes because that's going to keep it

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:36.750
very tight and keep the overspray away

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:40.910
so on this side as I tape here Diaz is

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.910
going and cutting for me

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:59.190
oh yes sorry I read taped it all nice

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.190
and yellow

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.059
[Music]

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.649
so then across the bottom what he'll do

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.089
is he'll cut the whole thing and we'll

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:17.339
just take the bottom I'll hold it up for

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:18.899
you so that way yeah you can cut in the

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:21.300
middle you always want to cut right in

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:24.209
the middle of the tape and what that

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.069
will do is give you room to still put

00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:28.619
the tape over because you don't want the

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:31.010
plastic and the tape at the same spot

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:35.540
finishing

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:38.080
[Music]

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.080
yeah

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:46.429
and I'll take that so we can keep it

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.059
[Music]

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:04.950
nice and then what we'll do here is Phil

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.440
fold it over and just to keep overspray

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:12.470
away and keep dirt down to a minimum

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:14.940
we'll run a couple pieces of to in-state

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.130
that is our last precaution what we'll

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.220
do to keep dust down as we'll go ahead

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:25.950
and we'll put some masking paper since I

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:28.920
since we do have a crossdress booth you

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.330
know the overspray can get everywhere

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.250
and if you have a spot that's not

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:38.430
incredibly tight you can just poke a

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:43.080
little hole in it and then just take

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:44.670
some tape and hold it back not every job

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.470
is gonna be super push super super

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.480
pretty okay so we just got it masked up

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.540
and yes there are areas that we should

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.580
be going into the next panel but we do

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.200
have a good color match and this is what

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.970
is going to be done on this job and

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.000
that's gonna be that and let's end this

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:02.910
video hey guys this is Brian from paint

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.829
Society just reminding you don't

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.829
overthink it it's just paint
